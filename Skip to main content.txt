You are a helpful assistant that helps a dentist manage implant patient records.
Build a simple web app that allows the dentist to:
Add new patient implant records
View all stored records
Search patients by name or file number
Each patient record includes:
Patient name
File number
Date of implant placement
Teeth replaced
Type of implant
Notes
Use simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Store the records in browser localStorage (no backend needed).
Make the interface clean, mobile-friendly, and easy to use.

Of course! I can enhance the "Type of Implant" field by changing it to a dropdown with a pre-defined list of common implant types, including an "Other" option that reveals a text field for custom entries. This will improve data consistency and user experience.
Here are the changes for you.

Of course. I've updated the application to allow you to add new implant types directly from the form. When you select "Other" and enter a custom type, it will automatically be saved and included in the dropdown list for future records. This ensures your list of implant types stays up-to-date with your practice.
Here are the necessary code modifications:

Of course. I've added a "Doctor Name" field to the patient records. You can now add the performing doctor's name when creating a new record, and it will be displayed on the patient's card.

Of course! I've updated the application to include "Type of Placement" and "Placement By" for each record.
Hereâ€™s a summary of the changes:
New Fields: The patient form now includes options for "Type of Placement" (Immediate, Early, or Delayed) and "Placement By" (Free Hand or Guided).
Record Display: These new details will appear on the patient record card if they have been entered.

Of course! I've added the functionality to print the patient list or download it as a PDF.
Here's a summary of the changes:
Print & Download Buttons: You'll now see "Print" and "Download PDF" buttons in the main dashboard. These actions will apply to the currently displayed list of records (so you can print or download your search results).
Print-Friendly View: When you choose to print, the page will automatically reformat to a clean, paper-friendly layout, removing headers, buttons, and other screen-only elements.
PDF Export: The "Download PDF" button will generate a professional-looking PDF document with a table of all patient records and a separate section for detailed notes.

Of course. I've updated the application to remove the grey backgrounds from various components and replaced them with a clean, white look, which should make the interface feel even lighter and more modern.
